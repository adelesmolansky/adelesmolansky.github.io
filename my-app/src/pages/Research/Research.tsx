          We are trying to understand how current research in this areas has
          been applied to students with cognitive disabilities and thus what is
          known about how to develop adaptive algorithms in edtech that
          personalize to students cognitive abilities.

          We currently do not know whether commerically available edtech games
          are accessible for students with physical disabilities. We also do not
          have an evaluation method that can help us determine the accessibility
          of these games. Through literature review and interview studies, we
          are designing an evaluation method and will use our method to evaluate
          the accessibility of current websites.

          (AT) to navigate websites, we are interesting in the industry of AT
          that is responsible for creating and supplying students with AT.
