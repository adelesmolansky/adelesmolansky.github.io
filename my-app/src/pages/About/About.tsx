                My name is Adele Smolansky, and I'm an entrepreneur, researcher,
                and innovator! I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Cornell
                University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science as a
                Merrill Presidential Scholar. After one year of my PhD at
                Stanford University in Learning Sciences and Technology Design
                (LSTD), I decided to take a leave of absence and graduate with a
                masters from Stanford to work full-time on my startup,
                AI-Learners. I am grateful for the Stanford Graduate Fellowship
                (SGF) and the National Science Fellowship (NSF) for supporting
                my PhD work.

                During my first summer at Google, I interned with the Google
                Drive team, working on the Google Drive Counter Abuse project.
                While developing interactive and secure web pages for the Drive
                Abuse team using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, I became a stronger
                front-end programmer. I also improved my Java skills by using
                Java to work with APIs to access data from the backend and set
                proto values to support frontend logic. Since technology should
                be accessible to all users, I improved the accessibility of the
                web pages and conducted accessibility testing using Google's
                accessibility testing framework.

                During my second internship with Google, I wanted to learn more
                about how Google handled accessibility, so I joined the Android
                Accessibility team. I developed a new Android Accessibility
                Service to help developers make their apps more accessible,
                which involved integrating machine learning models to identify
                missing accessibility properties in data structures. I then used
                the new service to solve Talkback bugs and presented my work to
                the Android Accessibility team.
