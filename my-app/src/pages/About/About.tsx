        <p className="paragraphText">
          My name is Adele Smolansky, and I'm an undergraduate senior studying
          Computer Science at Cornell University . Inspired by my younger
          sister, who has a severe neurological disability called Rett Syndrome,
          I founded AI-Learners, an educational technology company that helps
          kids with disabilities learn math. To better understand how EdTech can
          support students with disabilities, I'm conducting research at two
          labs at Cornell University: the Cornell Future of Learning Lab and the
          Enhancing Ability Lab at Cornell.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraphText">
          Starting Fall of 2023, I will pursue a PhD at the intersection of
          education, computer science, and neuroscience to increase our
          scientific understanding of how children learn and how educational
          technology can improve student learning outcomes. Ultimately, my goal
          is to help all students have equal access to educational resources and
          maximize learning for each student with technology.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraphText">
          With an understanding of the complexities of creating inclusive
          technology, I'm committed to educating other professionals about
          accessibility. I've greatly enjoyed teaching dozens of students and
          professionals about accessibility at Cornell and conferences around
          the country. In graduate school, I hope to raise awareness about the
          challenges that people with disabilities face and educate designers
          and engineers to consider diverse users in product development so
          future technology reflects the needs of all individuals.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mainTextSectionTitle">Research Interests</h2>
        <p className="paragraphText">
          I am broadly interested in researching how children learn and how
          educational technology can improve student learning outcomes. As the
          learning sciences are a highly interdisciplinary field, I seek to use
          mixed methods research and collaborate with many researchers.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraphText">Some of my research questions include:</p>
        <ul className="paragraphText bulletedList">
          <li>
            How does a child's brain develop, and how is this development
            impacted by a cognitive disability such as dyscalculia, dyslexia,
            and ADHD?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we apply our understanding of how children learn to create
            more effective educational resources?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we model student learning with artificial intelligence?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we co-design EdTech resources with students, parents, and
            teachers to optimize engagement and learning outcomes?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we incorporate a student's cognitive abilities within
            adaptive EdTech learning algorithms to improve personalization?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we design EdTech to be more accessible for students with
            physical and cognitive disabilities?
          </li>
          <li>
            How can we facilitate more effective interactions between students
            and teachers to improve educational outcomes?
          </li>

        <p className="paragraphText">
          AI-Learners is an educational technology company that helps students
          of all abilities learn math. I founded AI-Learners in June 2020 and
          have worked with dozens of students and faculty from Cornell
          University to develop the company. I have also collaborated with
          hundreds of special needs students, educators, and AT specialists.

        <h3 className="secondHeadingText">Research</h3>
        <p className="paragraphText">
          This year, I am leading multiple research projects at two research
          labs at Cornell University.

        <p className="paragraphText">
          I am also the Student Member of the Society for Learning Analytics
          Research (SoLAR) Executive Committee! My goal is for more researchers
          to be aware of the complex needs of students with disabilities so
          special needs students are more represented in learning analytics. As
          a member of the SoLAR Executive Committee, I will advocate for people
          with disabilities in learning analytics research.

          <b>Summer 2021: STEP Intern on the Google Drive Team</b>
          <br></br>During my first summer at Google, I interned with the Google
          Drive team, working on the Google Drive Counter Abuse project. While
          developing interactive and secure web pages for the Drive Abuse team
          using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, I became a stronger front-end
          programmer. I also improved my Java skills by using Java to work with
          APIs to access data from the backend and set proto values to support
          frontend logic. Since technology should be accessible to all users, I
          improved the accessibility of the web pages and conducted
          accessibility testing using Google's accessibility testing framework.

        <p className="paragraphText">
          <b>Summer 2022: SWE Intern on the Android Accessibility Team</b>
          <br></br>During my second internship with Google, I wanted to learn
          more about how Google handled accessibility, so I joined the Android
          Accessibility team. I developed a new Android Accessibility Service to
          help developers make their apps more accessible, which involved
          integrating machine learning models to identify missing accessibility
          properties in data structures. I then used the new service to solve
          Talkback bugs and presented my work to the Android Accessibility team.
