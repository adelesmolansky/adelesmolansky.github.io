                is a digital learning platform I founded to make early math and
                literacy accessible for students with disabilities. Inspired by
                my sister Lara, who has Rett Syndrome, I designed and built
                AI-Learners from the ground upâ€”leading engineering, product, and
                research.

                I led a distributed team of 4 people, including Sam Masto (Head
                of Engineering), Tran Hoang (Head of Product), and two offshore
                developers. We are also supported by advisors including Cornell
                and Stanford University Researchers, Google engineers,
                accessibility specialists, and special education teachers. I am
                the CEO and Founder of AI-Learners, working on the product,
                engineering, and sales.
