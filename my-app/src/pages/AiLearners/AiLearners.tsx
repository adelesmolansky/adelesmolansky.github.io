            is a digital learning platform I founded to make early math and
            literacy accessible for students with disabilities. Inspired by my
            sister Lara, who has Rett Syndrome, I designed and built AI-Learners
            from the ground upâ€”leading engineering, product, and research.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led a distributed team of 4 people, including Sam Masto (Head of
            Engineering), Tran Hoang (Head of Product), and two offshore
            developers. We are also supported by advisors including Cornell and
            Stanford University Researchers, Google engineers, accessibility
            specialists, and special education teachers. I am the CEO and
            Founder of AI-Learners, working on the product, engineering, and
            sales.
          </p>

          <p>
            We raised $350,000 in grant funding and $250,000 in angel
            investment.
          </p>
