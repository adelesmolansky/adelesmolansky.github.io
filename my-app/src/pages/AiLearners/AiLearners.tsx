					<b> AI-Learners makes learning math accessible and engaging for students 
						with cognitive, physical, and behavioral disabilities through personalized 
						computer games and analytics.</b> 
						<br></br><br></br>
						Adele Smolansky was inspired by her younger 
						sister Lara, who has a severe neurological disability called Rett Syndrome, 
						to create AI-Learners. In the summer of 2020, Adele developed the first 
						iteration of AI-Learners with a small team of developers. Since then, 
						the company has grown into a team of 15+ student interns and 10+ professional 
						advisors who are united by the company values of teamwork, continuous learning, 
						and a drive to serve students with disabilities. AI-Learners now has 70+ math 
						games available across grade levels PreK-2nd grade, and over 100 parents 
						have created personal accounts for their children to practice math at 
						home.

			<p className="paragraphText">Adele loves collaborating with other people to develop AI-Learners. 
			Since starting AI-Learners in summer 2020, she has worked with almost 100 different Cornell students. 
			Adele created an Engineering Project team at Cornell to enable more students to join the team. 
			Not only does she help all students developing their coding, design, and business skills, but she also 
			teaches all team members about accessibility, cognitive functions, pedagogical theories, and more. </p>
			<p>The AI-Learners team is divided into 3 subteams: software development, business, and design.
